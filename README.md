# Git-it-done
Module 6 Project

## Purpose
Amiko is working on a web app that uses GitHub's API to search for open source projects with open issues and pull requests. Most of the HTML and CSS for this project is done, but Amiko needs you to add the JavaScript that will retrieve and display repositories and their open issue counts when a user searches for them.
